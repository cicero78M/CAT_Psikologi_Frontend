# CAT Psikologi Frontend

This project provides a very small web interface for the [CAT Psikologi Backend](https://github.com/cicero78M/CAT_Psikologi_Backend). It allows basic authentication and includes simple screens for question management, adaptive tests and admin tools.

## Setup

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app serves static files from the `public` folder on port `8080` by default. Ensure the backend is available on `http://localhost:3000` or update `API_URL` in `public/app.js`.
